                <h2>Welcome!</h2>
                <p>Welcome to the North Coast Adventure Series. What is the North Coast Adventure Series you ask. We are
                    a curated,
                    self-guided cycling series for those seeking
                    adventure along the roads and trails less traveled in and around Humboldt County, California. The
                    Adventure
                    Series allows you to ride the routes at your leisure, take beautiful photos, and win prizes!</p>

                <h3>Who Can Participate?</h3>

                <p>Anyone! You must have a Strava account (free account is fine) with your activity logged for
                    submission.</p>
                <h3>When?</h3>

                <p>The Series will run through 2021, ending on December 31, 2021. Youâ€™ll have the entire year to
                    complete the
                    routes.</p>
                <h3>What Are the Routes?</h3>
                <p>For 2021 we are focusing on loop routes. While not all routes will be complete loops, most will
                    consist of rides
                    that start and end at the same location without much overlap. Because we love all types of cycling,
                    the routes
                    will
                    cover all types of terrain from road rides, gravel roads, and single-track mountain bike trails. To
                    see the
                    selected
                    routes in detail, please visit the Routes page.

                <h3>How Does the Series Work?</h3>

                <p>Simple! Ride a route, sign in to the website, submit your ride information, win prizes! Once the ride
                    is verified
                    you see it listed in your dashboard. For full Adventure Series details please visit the <a
